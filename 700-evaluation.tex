\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{sec-evaluation}
%TODO EVALUATION: explain why motetrack is so slow. one is the deep object structure, another seems to be reading the signatures, which can't be done by simple mem copy as in the native version
%TODO EVALUATION: add more detail on individual benchmarks
%TODO EVALUATION: add some worst case benchmarks
%TODO EVALUATION: add section to investigate how the VM may perform on other platforms. vary number if registers available, and compare 32/16/8 bit versions of some benchmarks
%TODO EVALUATION: add conclusion to discuss variation in results. YMMV.

This dissertation presents a number of techniques to make sensor node virtual machines safe, and improve their performance
