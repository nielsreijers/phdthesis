This dissertation would not have been possible without the help of many people along the way, to whom I owe my deepest gratitude.

First of all, I would like to thank Professor Jane Hsu and Professor Daniel Shih, my two supervisors at NTU, for all your time and support. Professor K. J. Lin, for starting the project that gave me the opportunity to work at the Intel-NTU Connected Context Computing Center, and eventually lead to this work. And Professor Pai H. Chou, for always making time to have an inspiring talk and for your valuable feedback on my writings.

Special thanks to Professor Koen Langendoen, who, as my first supervisor during my time at Delft University, taught me most of what I know about doing research. I still use the things you taught me on an almost daily basis, both inside and outside of research. 

This dissertation builds on earlier work by Joshua Ellul. Thanks for coming to Taipei and for the nice collaboration.

During the seven years it took to complete this dissertation, I had the priviledge to be able to combine my reseach in Taiwan with work at DSW Zorgverzekeraar in The Netherlands. Thanks go out to Jeroen de Haan and Frans ten Brink for making this possible, and to my colleagues, in particular Edwin Haddeman and Jeroen Staphorsius for taking an interest in my work and for your useful comments.

Living in a foreign country is immensely rewarding, but not without challenges. One constant factor from the beginning of my stay in Taiwan has been Bormann Chen. Thanks for helping me out on countless occassions, for being such a good friend, and for still not giving up on me learning Chinese.

The long process of completing a PhD can be lonely at times, and I am grateful for the company of three people in particular. Thanks Ami for spending many days studying together, and for always taking care of my cat while I'm travelling, Ching-chi for all your support and for keeping me company during many late nights in the lab, and Dayton for being my partner in discovering many good coffee shops in Taipei to work in, and for the many games of chess to relax after a good day's work.

And finally thanks to my parents, my first and most important teachers.
